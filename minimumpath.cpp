"This is a C++ implementation of the "Minimum Path Sum" problem, which is a dynamic programming problem. The goal is to find the minimum sum of a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, where you can only move down or right.

The implementation initializes a 2D vector called sum with the same dimensions as the input grid and initializes each element to the value of the top-left corner of grid. The first two loops then compute the minimum sum for each element in the first row and column of sum, respectively, by adding the corresponding elements from grid and the previous element in the same row or column in sum. Finally, the last loop computes the minimum sum for each remaining element in sum by taking the minimum of the sum of the element to the left and the element above plus the corresponding element in grid."
